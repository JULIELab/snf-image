# IMAGE_NAME: Name of the image to use
# Generally you use the name of the image with the version of the OS included.
# Examples include:
#   centos-5.4 debian-4.0 fedora-12
# IMAGE_NAME=""

# IMAGE_DIR: directory location for disk images
# IMAGE_DIR="/var/lib/snf-image"

# IMAGE_DEBUG: turn on debugging output for the scripts
# IMAGE_DEBUG=0

# HELPER_DIR: Directory hosting the helper files
# HELPER_DIR="/var/lib/snf-image/helper/"

# HELPER_IMG: Path to the helper VM image
# HELPER_IMG="${HELPER_DIR}/image"

# HELPER_KERNEL: Path to the helper VM kernel
# HELPER_KERNEL="${HELPER_DIR}/kernel"

# HELPER_INITRD: Path to the helper VM initial ramdisk
# HELPER_INITRD="${HELPER_DIR}/initrd"

# HELPER_PKG: Path to the snf-image-helper package
# HELPER_PKG="${HELPER_DIR}/snf-image-helper.deb"

# HELPER_TIMOUT: Soft and hard timeout limits for helper instance.
# The helper instance will be terminated after a given time if it hasn't exited
# by itself.
#
# When HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT seconds have passed, a SIGTERM is sent.
# When HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT seconds more have passed, a SIGKILL is sent.
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT="15"
# HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT="5"

# HELPER_USER: For security reasons, it is recommended that the helper VM
# runs as an unprivileged user. KVM drops root privileges and runs as
# HELPER_USER imeddiately before starting execution of the helper VM.
# HELPER_USER="nobody"

# HELPER_CACHE_FILE: Cache file update-helper script uses to avoid running
# `debootstrap' all the time.
# HELPER_CACHE_FILE="${HELPER_DIR}/cache.tar"

# HELPER_CACHE_PKGS: Debian Packages the cache file contains.
# HELPER_CACHE_PKGS="${HELPER_DIR}/packages"

# HELPER_EXTRA_PKGS: Extra packages that will need to be supplied
# to debootstrap to make the resulting helper image workable.
# DO NOT OVERWRITE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
# HELPER_EXTRA_PKGS="linux-image-amd64,e2fsprogs,ntfs-3g,ntfsprogs,xmlstarlet,python,parted,reglookup,chntpw,util-linux"

# HELPER_MIRROR: Debian mirror to use with debootstrap. Using a mirror close to
# you will speed up the whole debootstraping process. By default we do not
# define a mirror. Debootstrap will use it's default debian URL.
# HELPER_MIRROR="http://ftp.debian.org/debian"

# PITHOS_DB: Pithos database in SQLAlchemy format
# PITHOS_DB="sqlite:////var/lib/pithos/backend.db"

# PITHOS_DATA: Directory where pithos data are hosted
# PITHOS_DATA="/var/lib/pithos/data"

# PROGRESS_MONITOR: External program that monitors the progress of the image
# deployment. For now, this program is treated by snf-image as a decorator for
# the raw copy command that copies the image file to the instance's hard disk.
# This program must support the following options:
#   -r, which specifies the expected number of bytes to be written to the disk.
#   -i, which specifies the Ganeti instance name.
# PROGRESS_MONITOR=""

# Paths for needed programs. Uncommend and change the variables below if you
# don't want to use the default one.
# LOSETUP="losetup"
# KPARTX="kpartx"
# SFDISK="sfdisk"
# QEMU_IMG="qemu-img"
# INSTALL_MBR="install-mbr"
