2012-11-20, v0.6.5

2012-11-15, v0.6.4
	* Fix a bug in snf-image-update-helper introduced in v0.6.3

2012-11-13, v0.6.3
	* Fix a bug in snf-image-update-helper where the temporary image file
	  was not removed if an error occured.

2012-10-12, v0.6.2
	* Seperate the error messages that should be logged by the system from
	  those that should be propagated to the user through the monitoring
	  mechanism. Don't allow internal configuration options get revieled to
	  the user.

2012-10-05, v0.6.1
	* Use Coordinated Universal Time when logging.
	* Fix a bug in the way snf-image-update-helper reads the links of the
	  kernel and the initrd in the helper VM.
	* Use environmental variables instead of input options to pass sensitive
	  data to pithcat. This is needed because when pithcat is running, every
	  user can see the program's command line by using ps.

2012-09-15, v0.6
	* Fix import and export scripts
	* Add new config_url os parameter. This can be used by snf-image to
	  download a json file that contains the value for other os parameters

2012-08-31, v0.5
	* Add a new progress monitoring mechanism. With this new mechanism,
	  snf-image can output progress and error messages to external programs
	  when running.
	* Make the name of image properties case insensitive
	* Abandon timelimit command in favor of timeout
	* Add support for null image backend type. This backend type can be
	  used if we want snf-image to configure the VM disk without first
	  copying an image to it.

2012-06-29, v0.4.2

2012-05-28, v0.4.1

2012-05-17, v0.4
	* Remove progress-monitor-support flag. An external progress monitor
	  programm will be used if --with-progress-monitor flag is used in
	  configure or if PROGRESS_MONITOR variable in the defaults file has a
	  non-empty value
	* Remove --enable-pithos-backend option in configure. This will be
	  detected at runtime
	* Create package list in snf-update-helper every time debootstrap is
	  performed. If a cache file is found, snf-update-helper will use this
	  list to determine if it is OK to use this cache file or not.
	* Add mechanism for overwritting the helper's Unattend.xml file

2012-03-29, v0.3.6
	* Make snf-image-update-helper ask whether to use the found deboostrap
	  cache file when in interactive mode.
	* Make the system update the default debootstrap cache file when -c
	  option is used and it's value does not point to a cache file.

2012-03-26, v0.3.5

2012-03-05, v0.3.4

2012-02-29, v0.3.3

	  that can be accessed from a URL
