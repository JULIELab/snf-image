# IMAGE_DEBUG: turn on debugging output for the scripts
# IMAGE_DEBUG=no

# CLOUD_INIT_DEBUG: Turn cloud-init debug level on. If set to 'yes' and the
# instance is cloud-init enabled, snf-image-helper will inject into the
# instance a logging configuration for cloud-init that will log all messages
# with priority DEBUG or higher to /var/log/snf-image/cloud-init-debug.log. It
# will also prevent some cloud-init configuration files injected by
# snf-image-helper that contain sensitive data from being cleared out.
# CLOUD_INIT_DEBUG=no

# HELPER_DIR: Directory hosting the helper files
# HELPER_DIR="@localstatedir@/lib/snf-image/helper/"

# HELPER_TIMEOUT: Soft and hard timeout limits for helper instance. The helper
# instance will be terminated after a given time if it hasn't exited by itself.
# A TERM signal will be send if the instance is running after a
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT interval. A KILL signal will be sent, if the instance is
# still running after a HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT interval since the initial signal
# was sent. The timeout values are integer numbers with an optional suffix: `s'
# for seconds (the default), `m' for minutes, `h' for hours or `d' for days.
# HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT="120"
# HELPER_HARD_TIMEOUT="5"

# HELPER_USER: For security reasons, it is recommended that the helper VM
# runs as an unprivileged user. KVM drops root privileges and runs as
# HELPER_USER immediately before starting execution of the helper VM.
# HELPER_USER="nobody"

# HELPER_MEMORY: Virtual RAM size in megabytes to be given to the helper VM.
# HELPER_MEMORY="512"

# HELPER_DEBUG: When enabled, the helper VM will drop to a root shell
# whenever a task fails. This allows the administrator or a developer
# to examine its internal state for debugging purposes.
# To access the shell, use a program like 'minicom' to connect to /dev/pts/X on
# the host, where /dev/pts/X is the name of the device reported in the Ganeti
# OS installation logs for helper's 3rd serial port, e.g.,
# "char device redirected to /dev/pts/9 (label serial3)".
# This feature is KVM-specific for the time being.
# For HELPER_DEBUG to be useful, you also need to set HELPER_SOFT_TIMEOUT
# to a much higher value.
# WARNING: DO NOT ENABLE THIS FEATURE IN PRODUCTION. Every failure to deploy
# an Image will cause the helper VM to hang.
# HELPER_DEBUG="no"

# MULTISTRAP_CONFIG: Configuration file to be used with multistrap to create
# the rootfs of the helper image.

# XEN_SCRIPTS_DIR: Directory where the Xen scripts are stored
# XEN_SCRIPTS_DIR="@sysconfdir@/xen/scripts"

# XEN_CMD: This variable specifies the Xen CLI tool snf-image should use. This
# depends on the XEN version and configuration and should probably coincide
# with the Ganeti's xen_cmd hypervisor parameter for xen-hvm or xen-pvm. Right
# now the supported ones are 'xm' and 'xl'.
# XEN_CMD="@XEN_CMD@"

# PITHOS_DB: Pithos database in SQLAlchemy format
# PITHOS_DB="sqlite:////@localstatedir@/lib/pithos/backend.db"

# PITHOS_BACKEND_STORAGE: Select Pithos backend storage. Possible values are
# 'nfs' and 'rados'. According to the value you select, you need to set the
# corresponding variables that follow.
# If you select 'nfs' that's 'PITHOS_DATA'. If you select 'rados' then you need
# to set all the "*_RADOS_*" ones.
# PITHOS_BACKEND_STORAGE="nfs"

# PROGRESS_MONITOR: External program that monitors the progress of the image
# deployment. The snf-image monitor messages will be redirected to the standard
# input of this program.
# PROGRESS_MONITOR="@PROGRESS_MONITOR@"

# DHCP_TAGS: Space separated list of Ganeti network tags. snf-image will
# configure a VM's NIC to use DHCP if the card is expected to have an IPv4
# address and any of those tags is present in the card's NETWORK_TAGS variable.
# DHCP_TAGS="auto dhcp nfdhcpd"

# STATEFUL_DHCPV6_TAGS: Space separated list of Ganeti network tags. snf-image

# variable.
# STATEFUL_DHCPV6_TAGS="dhcpv6 stateful_dhcpv6"

# STATELESS_DHCPV6_TAGS: Space separated list of Ganeti network tags. snf-image

# is expected to have an IPv6 address and any of those tags is present in the
# card's NETWORK_TAGS variable.
# STATELESS_DHCPV6_TAGS="nfdhcpd stateless_dhcpv6"

# DEFAULT_NIC_CONFIG: This option defines the network configuration to be
# performed if there is a default NIC attached to the instance with no further
# information associated with it. This will happen if the user creates an
# instance and does not define any of the --net and --no-nics input arguments.
# In this case Ganeti will create a NIC with a random MAC and set up according
# to the cluster level NIC parameters. The user may want to leave this NIC
# unconfigured (by leaving this option empty), perform "dhcp" or use one of the
# various IPv6 auto configuration methods. The supported IPv6 methods are:
# "dhcpv6" (Stateful DHCPv6), "slaac_dhcp" (Stateless DHCPv6) and "slaac"
# (Stateless Autoconfiguration). IPv4 and IPv6 configuration methods can be
# defined in conjunction using the plus (`+') sign. IPv4 must precede (e.g.:
# "dhcp+slaac_dhcp").
# DEFAULT_NIC_CONFIG="dhcp"

# UNATTEND: This variable overwrites the unattend.xml file used when deploying
# a Windows image. snf-image-helper will use its own unattend.xml file if this
# variable is empty.
# WARNING: This variable is DEPRECATED. If you need to define an answer file
# different that the one shipped with snf-image, which is very likely, put it
# inside the image or use the os_answer_file OS parameter.
# UNATTEND="@UNATTEND@"

# WINDOWS_TIMEZONE: This variable is used to specify the time zone when
# deploying a Windows image. This will only work if you are using snf-image's
# default OS answer file. If the Windows image already contains an answer file,
# which should by itself specify a time zone in order to have an unattended
# Windows customization process, this variable will be completely ignored. For
# a list of available time zones, check here:
