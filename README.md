Overview

This is snf-image, a [Ganeti](http://code.google.com/p/ganeti) OS provider
primarily used by the Synnefo cloud management software to deploy VM instances
from predefined or custom Images.

It comprises two distinct components:
* snf-image-host, which executes as a privileged process on the Ganeti host
* snf-image-helper, which executes inside a helper VM and undertakes all
  security-sensitive customization of a Ganeti VM.
