Description: URL to download snf-image-helper from:
 This package already contains a build-in URL to download the helper image from.
 However, if you'd like to use a custom one, please enter a URL prefix. The
 program will try to download the helper image from:
       <URL>/snf_image_helper_image-@VERSION@.tar.xz
 If you don't want the package to download the helper image at all, leave this
 field blank.
